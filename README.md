# Installation

## RKM Mission Control

### Install InfluxDB
The RKM-Outpost metrics are stored in an InfluxDB.  
If you don't already have an InfluxDB, install one for example with the [InfluxDB Helm Chart](https://github.com/influxdata/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/influxdb) on Kubernetes.  
The InfluxDB and RKM-Outpost have a few dependencies:
1. The InfluxDB must be reachable for RKM-Outpost
3. An InfluxDB database for the RKM-Outpost metrics, for example "rkm"
4. User and password for the InfluxDB database

### Install Grafana
If your don't have a Grafana instance, install one for example with the [Grafana Helm Chart](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/grafana) on Kubernetes. Grafana must have access to the InfluxDB database.  
Add the InfluxDB database as a datasource to Grafana and import the [RKM Mission Control Dashboard](https://github.com/onzack/rkm/blob/main/Grafana/rkm-mission-control-dashboard.json).

## RKM Outpost
Install RKM Outpost Helm Chart:  
1. Create rkm-outpost namespace:  
`kubectl create namespace rkm-outpost`
2. Create secret for InfluxDB authentication:  
`kubectl create secret generic rkm-secrets --from-literal=INFLUXDB_USER=<user> --from-literal=INFLUXDB_PW=<password> -n rkm-outpost`
3. Clone this repository:  
`git clone https://github.com/onzack/rkm.git`
4. Create and adjust the custom-values.yaml file for your cluster:  
`cp ./rkm/custom-values.yaml cluster-1-values.yaml`  
`vim custom-values.yaml`  

**Importat**
Take a special look at the proxy and CA configs, if you run RKM-Outpost behind a enterprise proxy or the InfluxDB SSL/TLS certificate is signed by a not well known CA.
And keep in mind, that the proxy support is early beta and not well tested at the moment.

5. Install Helm Chart:  
`helm install -f custom-values.yaml -n rkm-outpost rkm-outpost ./rkm/Helm/rkm-outpost`
